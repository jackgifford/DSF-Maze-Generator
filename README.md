# DSF-Maze-Generator

This is the repository for the first part of my Year 12 SDD Major Work. 

So far the project randomly generates a maze in a user defined sized square grid. It uses DSF, to achieve this, and the Fisher Yates algorithm to generate a random order to follow. So far this is the prototype of my project, and to help me learn about DSF I've been following this tutorial http://www.migapro.com/depth-first-search/ and converted the java applet into a C# Console Application.
